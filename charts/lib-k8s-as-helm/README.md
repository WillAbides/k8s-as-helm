# lib-k8s-as-helm

This is a helm [library chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts) that implements functionality used across several charts in the [k8s-as-helm](https://github.com/ameijer/k8s-as-helm) project. 

This chart contains primarily internal code used by application charts in this project, and cannot be instantiated or installed directly into a cluster itself.

It is published to a public repo primarily to establish a version history for CI builds against prior versions.
